* Each value is declared at the top of the file as `Dim <variable name> As <variable type>`
* The following are valid variable types:
  - `Object` synomous with `Array`
  - `String`
  - `Integer`
  - `Float`
  - `Boolean`

* Afterwards once all variables are declared you can then declare the contents of each variable.
* Each variable must be prefixed by it's index number. All root level index numbers count up from ten, by tens, such as `10`, `20`, `30`
* Within each variable declaration, if the variable has any nested levels, such as within an object you'd declare their index as floats, starting from the parent objects index such as a parent object of `10` child items would have the index of `10.10`, `10.20`, `10.30` and so on. Additional child items would function the same way, going `10.10.10` and so on.
* A single line comment: `<¿-- VALUE --?>`. Since the value within a comment is a string, it must be quoted as one.
* A multi line comment: `<¡--` on it's beginning line, and `--!>` on it's ending line. Again, since it's a string it must be quoted as one.
* When some values are used in a config they must be escapes, such as the declaration of an `Object` must use `<<object variable name>>`. Or when declaring the raw values of a string or integer or float must use `<<String Value>>`, `<<10>>`, `<<1.3>>`
* Each nested index of a config must also be appended with `#` to indicate the level of nesting, following the nesting index. This is because we don't trust numbers. Meaning a nest could look like `10.10 ##` or `10.20.10 ###`
* When assigning a value to a variable, you must use the assignment operator `:=`
* When declaring an object, you must indicate the beginning of the object with `[` and end the object with `];`
* `Boolean`s must receive the constants of `untrue` or `unfalse`. It's much more clear than just `true` or `false`
